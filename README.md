# üß† C++ Lua GameServer + Async DataServer (GS/DS System)

Welcome! This is a custom **GameServer + DataServer** architecture entirely written in **C++**, with all the logic controlled via **Lua** and full asynchronous SQL communication using **UDP**.

I built this alone ‚Äî it might not be perfect, but I gave it my best. I hope it helps others, and feel free to improve it or use it in your own projects!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This system is split into two main components:

### üéÆ GameServer (GS)

Responsible for:
- Handling player connections
- Processing packets
- Movement, combat, logic, validations
- Calling Lua events and controlling all gameplay logic

### üß† DataServer (DS)

Responsible for:
- Receiving SQL queries via UDP
- Processing them **asynchronously**
- Returning results to GameServer
- Controlled entirely via Lua

> **Why not use threads inside GS?**  
> Because I believe in **modularity**. For me, running SQL logic in a separate executable (`DataServer`) and communicating via UDP is cleaner, safer, and more scalable.

---

## üöÄ How to use

1. Compile both **GameServer** and **DataServer** using Visual Studio.
2. Place your `main.lua` and `SystemCore.lua` (or your main Lua logic files) next to each executable. -> They have their own SystemCore/main inside lua folder DS and GS!
3. Launch the GameServer and DataServer ‚Äî they will initialize their own threads and Lua states.

The servers communicate through UDP, and Lua handles the entire logic.

## üß© GameServer Lua Bridge Functions

These functions are automatically called by the engine:

OnClientConnect(socketID)
OnPacketRecv(socketID, headCode, subCode, data, dataLen)
OnClientDisconnect(socketID)
OnGlobalTick() -- Called every second
OnSQLAsyncResult(label, param, result)

## üß© GameServer Interface Functions (usable from Lua)

DisconnectClient(socketID)        -- Forces disconnection
BufferCreate()                    -- Creates a new buffer
BufferGetSize(bufferID)          -- Returns buffer size
BufferFromData(dataString)       -- Creates buffer from packet data (use in OnPacketRecv)
BufferDelete(bufferID)           -- Deletes the buffer

-- Reading from buffer
BufferReadByte(bufferID)
BufferReadWord(bufferID)
BufferReadDword(bufferID)
BufferReadString(bufferID)

-- Writing to buffer
BufferWriteByte(bufferID, value)
BufferWriteWord(bufferID, value)
BufferWriteDword(bufferID, value)
BufferWriteString(bufferID, "text")

-- Sending
SendBuffer(socketID, bufferID)    -- Sends buffer to the client

-- Utilities
LogText("Debug message")          -- Print to server console
DSQuery(query, label, param)     -- Sends SQL query to DataServer

## üí° Use /reload in the console to reload Lua scripts without restarting the server.

## üß© DataServer Lua Bridge

OnDsQuery(size, query, label, param)

## üß© DataServer Interface Functions (usable from Lua)

-- SQL Management
SQLConnect("odbc", "user", "pass")
SQLDisconnect()

-- Query Execution
SQLQuery("SELECT * FROM ...")       -- Returns true if success
SQLFetch()                          -- Call this to fetch each row
SQLClose()                          -- Ends result set
SQLFree()                           -- Frees current query and processes next in queue

-- Data Retrieval (inside Fetch)
SQLGetNumber(columnIndex)
SQLGetString(columnIndex)
SQLGetFloat(columnIndex)

-- Result control
SQLGetResult()        -- true if last query succeeded
SQLIsConnected()      -- true if SQL is connected

-- Communication
SendPacket(label, param, resultString)   -- Send async result back to GameServer

-- Debug
LogText("Hello world")

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

label and param are always max 10 characters and padded with spaces ("label ").

You must trim them in Lua using string.gsub(label, "%s+$", "") or similar before using.

This system is designed to be modular, scalable and readable.

## üì¶ Why use this system?

## üß† Clean separation of game logic and database

## üìú Full Lua control over gameplay

## üöÄ Real asynchronous SQL communication via UDP

## üõ†Ô∏è Easily extendable, open-source, and readable

## üîÅ Hot-reload of Lua scripts in real time
